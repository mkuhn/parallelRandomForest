This repository contains a modified version of the original RF package for R. The function randomForest
behaves identical, with two additional parameters: skip.checks (default: true) disables checking the
matrices for NAs, and nthreads specifies the number of threads to use.

Using more than one thread creates multiple forests that are then combined, due to the implementation of 
the "combine" function this means that some fields of the result are empty. Note that if your whole forest
could be grown in seconds, it doesn't make sense to use threads as there is some overhead (in terms of time)
to start a new subprocess.
